# VinylLog
This is a music collection manager based on the Discogs API. It's made using Django and React - and it's a personal project where I truly aim to log my vinyl collection in it, so there is a learning, but also functional aspect to it.

The project started in March 2023 as a simple CRUD Display for the collection, however in April 2024 I decided to come back to it and enhance it further, using the Discogs API so I can add records faster, and also to introduce React and a better design to the app.

The main branch contains the apps V1, developed in 2023.

## Goals
- Refactor frontend (adding React);
- Add Discogs API integration: import records to the app;
- More to come!!!
